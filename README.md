# the-km-miles-conversion-app

This repository consists of code used for the creation of the application named *Miles And Km*, which can convert the user-entered Miles input into km output or the user-entered km into miles. The application, a rather simple one, was created using **Android Studio** with no special intention, but just as part of assignment during a course. It shows the functionality of buttons and how the user-entered input is considered for output. Simple projects like these will help learning: to work with the Android Studio platform.
